*Summary: Full-length Dengue virus genome from 2013 outbreak in Martin County, Florida. [Data here](https://github.com/andersen-lab/dengue-florida).*

#### Overview
Serum was obtained from a single patient during the 2013 Dengue virus serotype 1 outbreak in Martin County in Florida. Patient serum (250uL) was inoculated into a T-25 flask of C6/36 cells, incubated @ RT for 20 days, blind passaged, and incubated for another 31 days. After this first passage, the sample was split into two and one sample (DV1_Vero) was subject to one additional passage in Vero cells, and the other sample (DV1_c6/36) was subject to one additional passage in C6/36 cells.

#### Sequencing

RNA was extracted and metagenomic sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq after rRNA depletion following the protocol in Matranga et al. (Genome Biol 2014). 

#### Samples

DV1_vero	One passage in C6/36 cells, one additional passage in Vero cells
DV1_c6/36	One passage in C6/36 cells, one additional passage in C6/36 cells

Both consensus sequences were identical - this was confirmed by additional sequencing of biological replicates (separate RNA extractions)

#### Alignment

ORF-complete DENV-1 genomes were downloaded from ViPR and an alignment together with the Martin County DENV-1 sequence was created using MAFFT.

#### Tree

A tree was created based on the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment using RAxML.
